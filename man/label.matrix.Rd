\title{Name PWM & MM rows and columns}
\usage{
  label.matrix(mat, columnsOnly = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{mat}{Matrix of which have the column and row names
  populated}

  \item{columnsOnly}{Only name the columns, not the rows}
}
\value{
  Matrix with columns and (rows optional) named
}
\description{
  Given a list of PWM or MM matrices, name the rows and
  columns (if applicable) This function is used for
  specifying the names of rows and columns for Markov
  Models and Position Weight Matrices(PWMs) only.  In the
  case of naming PWMs, set columnsOnly to true, as it
  doesn't make sense to name the rows of a PWM.  The
  columns are named 'A,C,G,T'.  The rows are uniquely
  named, staring with A going to T If there are more than 4
  rows, two characters are used AA, AC..., if more than 16
  rows 3 characters are used, and so on.
