\arguments{

}
\value{
  an MS object stored in R.  If src is already stored in R,
  returns the original object.

\description{
  RTFBS can store MS objects in R's memory, or C's memory
  for efficency reasons.  This function transforms an MS
  object whose data is stored in memory on the C side to an
  MS object whose data is stored on the R side.  The result
  is a new MS object containing data stored in memory on
  the R side copied from memory on the C side Copying an MS
  object from C into R enables modification of the MS
  object using generic R functions.  To do the reverse,
  (copying an MS object from R to C), use the as.pointer.ms
  function.
