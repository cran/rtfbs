\usage{
\method{split}{ms}(x, f, drop = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Multiple sequences object}

\item{f}{Numeric window size, or Features object used to determine where to split sequences}

\item{drop}{Currently not used (for S3 compatibility)}

\item{...}{Currently not used (for S3 compatibility)}
}
\value{
MS object, containing the split sequences
}
\description{
Split sequences in MS object at given locations, or based on a numeric window size.
If splitting based on a numeric window size, (i.e. every 500 bases) specify the
maximum number of bases per sequence in the \code{f} parameter.
If splitting based on specific locations, use read.feat(FullPath) to read in a 
BED file specifying the locations, and use the resulting object in the \code{f} 
parameter.
