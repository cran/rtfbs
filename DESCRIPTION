Title: R Transcription Factor Binding Site identification tool
Author: Nicholas Peterson, Andre Martins, Melissa Hubisz, and Adam
    Siepel
Description: RTFBS identifies and scores possible Transcription Factor
    Binding Sites and allows for FDR analysis and pruning.  It supports
    splitting of sequences based on size or a specified GFF, grouping
    by G+C content, and specification of Markov model order.  The heavy
    lifting is done in C while all results are made available via R.
